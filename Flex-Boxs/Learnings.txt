How to center a div
    1. Working on Main Axis (x-axis)
        1. justify-content
            flex start 
            flex end
            center 
            -----
            space between
            space around
            space evenly
    2. Working on Cross Axis (y-axis)
        1. align-items

Flex Direction
    row
    row reverse
    column

Gap Property
    gap ==> makes less use of margin
    row gap 
    column gap 
    flex wrap 
    flex nowrap 

align content
    space around (default value) ==> to center everything on the page

flex shrink: 0; ==> This can only be apply on flex items and not on flex container
(It basically prevents the shrinking of the object, 1 is the default value)

similarly you can use the flex grow property
flex grow: 1;
(you can also give the max width into px to tell the css that stop the growing of boxes when it reaches to that particular value)

for the flex shrink you can give the min width so it will only shrink the boxes to that particular min width

we can combine the flex shrink and flex wrap property using the media query

@media(max-width: 500px){
    body{
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
}
